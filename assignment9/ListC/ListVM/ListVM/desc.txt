ADD

Pop the top two values from the stack, v2 then v1 because v2.
Both must be integers (tagged integer representation used by the machine); the tags are removed and the machine adds the integer payloads.
The result is re-tagged as an integer and pushed onto the stack.
If either operand is not an integer, the machine signals a runtime type error.

CSTI i

Push the constant integer i (properly machine-tagged) onto the stack.
No heap access occurs; this is just a stack push of an immediate.

NIL

Push the special nil reference onto the stack (often represented as a reserved pointer value or a distinguished tag).
NIL represents the empty list / null pointer; it is a heap reference (not an integer).
Difference vs CSTI 0: CSTI 0 pushes an integer whose numeric value is zero (an immediate integer), whereas NIL pushes a reference/value that denotes the empty pointer. They have different tags and are treated differently by type tests and by the GC (an integer is not followed as a heap pointer; NIL is a special reference which the marking code treats as a pointer value that denotes "no object").

IFZERO

Pop the top value and test: if the thing is an integer, test whether it equals 0; if a reference, test whether it is nil.
If the test is true, jump to the true branch (or push a boolean / follow the branch per the machine encoding); otherwise take the false branch.
(Implementation detail) The instruction must first discriminate whether the value is an immediate integer or a heap reference and do the appropriate test.

CONS

Allocate a new 2-word heap block (a cons cell) containing head and tail fields.
Pop the top two values from the stack (usually tail then head), store them into the newly allocated block’s data words, and push a pointer/reference to that block onto the stack.
If allocation fails because there is no usable free block, the mutator must call the garbage collector to free unreachable blocks and retry allocation.

CAR

Pop (or read) a heap reference to a cons cell and push the first field (the car / head) onto the stack.
The instruction checks that the argument is a non-nil pair/cons; otherwise it signals an error.
No allocation; just a read from the cons cell’s first data word.

SETCAR

Pop a value and a heap reference (cons cell pointer) and write the value into the cons cell’s first field (car) in place.
This mutates a reachable heap block; because the mutator writes pointers into heap blocks, a precise GC must ensure such updates are visible/handled correctly (e.g., write-barrier in generational collectors).
For a simple mark–sweep, a write barrier is typically not required for correctness in a stop-the-world collector, but the mutation simply updates memory.
